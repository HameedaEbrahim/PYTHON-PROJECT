CAR FEATURES AND PRICE.
Introduction: The last several decades witnessed one of the significant changes in the automotive industry because of the increased environmental consciousness and technological development. In 1990-2017, the development of vehicles and fuel system was aimed at responding to the growing concerns regarding fuel consumption and carbon emission. The non-electric cars are still grossly less fuel efficient and have higher CO2 emissions than the electric ones despite the traditional internal combustion engines being improved. With the world working harder to mitigate the effects of climate change, the trends have become pivotal in informing future policy, innovation and product take-up of cleaner technologies by consumers. This discussion uses electric and non-electric vehicles to compare their performance over the years in terms of fuel efficiency, cost, and engine power, and comes up with the answer to how the electric technology is transforming the future of sustainable transportation.
