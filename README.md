##  Car Features and Price

### Promblem Statement 
---
Between 1990 and 2017, vehicle efficiency trends in the USA reveal that non-electric vehicles have 78% lower fuel efficiency and produce higher CO₂ emissions, highlighting the growing importance of electric technology in reducing environmental pollution.

###  Introduction
---
Over the last few decades, the automotive industry has undergone significant transformation driven by technological advancements and growing environmental awareness.  
Between 1990 and 2017, vehicle development focused on improving fuel systems and reducing carbon emissions.  
Despite improvements in internal combustion engines, non-electric cars remain less fuel-efficient and emit more CO₂ than electric ones.  
As the world pushes toward mitigating climate change, analyzing these trends helps inform future policy, innovation, and consumer adoption of cleaner technologies.  

### Approaches 
---
1. Which car brands have the highest average fuel efficiency?  
2. How does fuel efficiency vary across different car models?  
3. What is the relationship between vehicle size (compact, midsize, large) and fuel efficiency?  
4. How does engine horsepower affect a vehicle’s fuel efficiency?  
5. Is there a correlation between a car’s price and its fuel efficiency?  
6. Does horsepower influence the price of a vehicle?  
7. How do electric cars compare to non-electric cars in terms of count, price, and efficiency?


### Recommendations
---
- **Manufacturers** should continue investing in electric and hybrid technology to enhance performance while minimizing emissions.  
- **Consumers** seeking long-term savings and sustainability should consider electric or hybrid options, especially in compact and mid-size categories.  
- **Manufacturers** should increase investment in **fuel efficiency research**.  
- **Manufacturers** should implement **regenerative braking systems** in non-electric cars, as they are already used in electric models.
