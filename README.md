CAR FEATURES AND PRICE.
Introduction: The last several decades witnessed one of the significant changes in the automotive industry because of the increased environmental consciousness and technological development. In 1990-2017, the development of vehicles and fuel system was aimed at responding to the growing concerns regarding fuel consumption and carbon emission. The non-electric cars are still grossly less fuel efficient and have higher CO2 emissions than the electric ones despite the traditional internal combustion engines being improved. With the world working harder to mitigate the effects of climate change, the trends have become pivotal in informing future policy, innovation and product take-up of cleaner technologies by consumers. This discussion uses electric and non-electric vehicles to compare their performance over the years in terms of fuel efficiency, cost, and engine power, and comes up with the answer to how the electric technology is transforming the future of sustainable transportation.
Approaches : 1- Which car brands have the highest average fuel efficiency?
             2- How does fuel efficiency vary across different car models?
             3- What is the relationship between vehicle size (compact, midsize, large) and fuel efficiency?
             4- How does engine horsepower affect a vehicle’s fuel efficiency?
             5- Is there a correlation between a car’s price and its fuel efficiency?
             6- Does horsepower influence the price of a vehicle?
             7- How do electric cars compare to non-electric cars in terms of count, price, and efficiency?
Recommendations:  1- Manufacturers should continue investing in electric and hybrid technology to enhance performance while minimizing                         emissions.
                  2- Consumers seeking long-term savings and sustainability should consider electric or hybrid options, especially in                          compact and mid-size categories.
                  3- Manufacuters should invest more in fuel efficiency researchs.
                  4- Manufacturers should implement regenerative braking systems in non-electric as they are already being implemented in                      electric cars.
